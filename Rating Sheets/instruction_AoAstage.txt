在本次实验中，您将评估下列单词的习得年龄阶段信息（即儿童第一次习得该单词及其含义的年龄阶段）。这些单词摘取自汉语沟通发展量表（长表），其中许多单词是在16-30月龄阶段习得的。举个例子，动词“拿”（na2）和名词“车”(che1)的习得年龄数据是16月龄，相对较早；而动词“装”（zhuang1）和名词“炉子”（lu2zi）的习得年龄数据是25月龄，相对较晚。实验中，汉语单词被转录为拼音，而有时一个拼音对应多个单词，如“xing1xing”可以对应“星星”或“猩猩”。在这种情况下，您可以根据这些单词为目标拼音给出平均后的打分。
请您以三分制进行评分，其中，1对应早期习得，2对应中期习得，3对应晚期习得。建议您考虑儿童导向的语言环境，例如父母与幼儿的家庭互动等。您可以按照自己的标准进行评分，但请尽量将这些单词均分为三个习得阶段。快快评分，不要粗心:)

The purpose of this experiment is to rate a list of words as to the Age of Acquisition (AoA), i.e., the age at which a child first learns the word and its meaning. The following words are selected from the Words and Sentences form of CCDI. Many of the words are supposed to be acquired over the 16-30 month period. For example, the AoA of "na2"(拿) and "che1"(车) are reported to be 16 month, a fairly early stage compared to other words; whereas "zhuang1"(装) and "lu2zi"(炉子) are reported to be learned at 25 month, a comparatively late stage. In this experiment, Mandarin words are transcirbed into pinyin, and one pinyin may be mapped to multiple words. For example, "xing1xing" could either refer to "星星"(star) or "猩猩"(gorilla). In such cases, you may give an averaged rating of the conflicting words for the target pinyin.
Your ratings will be made on a three-point scale, where one stands for the early stage and three for the late stage. Make your rating by typing a number from 1 to 3 that best indicates your judgement of the estimated stage of AoA. It is recommended that you take child-directed contexts into consideration, e.g., familial interaction with toddlers. Feel free to devise your own criterion for AoA estimation, however, try to classify the verbs and nouns evenly into three groups. Work fairly quickly but do not be careless in your ratings.
